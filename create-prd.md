# Create PRD (human‑first)

> **Agent mode:** Use `docs/prompts/create-prd.agent.md` for JSON‑only output conforming to `/specs/Prd.schema.json`.

**Instructions (for your AI IDE):**
1. Read the codebase context you provide (paths or snippets).
2. Ask clarifying questions if scope is unclear.
3. Produce a concise PRD covering: context, goals, non‑goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, open questions.
4. Keep scope tight; defer tangents to follow‑ups.
