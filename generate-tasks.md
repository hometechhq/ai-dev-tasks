# Generate Tasks (humanâ€‘first)

> **Agent mode:** Use `docs/prompts/generate-tasks.agent.md` (JSON array of Task objects matching `/specs/Task.schema.json`, no prose).

**Instructions (for your AI IDE):**
1. Read the PRD and any critical files.
2. Produce a numbered task list with titles, short descriptions, and acceptance criteria.
3. Note dependencies between tasks and mark any risky items.
4. Keep tasks as small as practical so each can be reviewed independently.
